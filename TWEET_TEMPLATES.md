## Option 2: Problem-Solution Focus

```
Information overload? 📚 → Quick summaries! ⚡

I built SummarizeBot using @mastra - an AI agent that condenses:
• Long articles
• PDF documents  
• Web pages
• Chat histories

Into clear, concise summaries (bullets or paragraphs).

Now live on @teleximapp!

Used @mastra framework to create SummarizeBot for @teleximapp:
✅ Multi-format support (text, PDFs, URLs)
✅ GPT-4 powered
✅ WebSocket + HTTP endpoints
✅ Persistent memory
✅ Full test coverage

Mastra made building AI agents surprisingly intuitive!

## Option 5: Technical Deep Dive

```
Building an AI agent with @mastra: A thread 🧵

1/ Just completed #HNGInternship Stage 3 by building SummarizeBot - an AI agent that summarizes content on @teleximapp

2/ Tech Stack:
- @mastra for agent framework
- OpenAI GPT-4 for AI
- TypeScript for type safety
- Express + WebSocket for communication
- Railway for deployment

3/ Key features:
✨ Multi-format support (text, PDF, DOCX, TXT, URLs)
✨ Flexible summary modes (brief/detailed)
✨ Persistent conversation memory
✨ Real-time WebSocket communication

4/ Biggest challenges:
• Web scraping different site structures
• Managing GPT-4 token limits
• Implementing persistent memory without a DB
• Testing non-deterministic AI responses

5/ What I learned:
- Mastra abstracts away boilerplate beautifully
- Good architecture scales
- User experience matters as much as tech
- Comprehensive testing catches issues early

6/ Try it yourself:

## Option 6: Casual/Fun

Confession: I hate reading long documents 😅

So I built an AI bot to do it for me! 🤖

SummarizeBot (powered by @mastra):
• Paste text/URL/document
• Get instant summary
• Choose bullet points or paragraphs
• Bot remembers your convos

Try it on @teleximapp: "@bot summarize"

Best #HNGInternship project yet!
